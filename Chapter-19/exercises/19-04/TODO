Exercise 19-4. Create a generic function that collects all elements of a vector<T>
that satisfy a given unary callback function. This callback function accepts a T value
and returns a Boolean value that indicates whether the element should be part of
the functionâ€™s output. The resulting elements are to be collected and returned in
another vector. Use this higher-order function to gather all numbers greater than a
user-provided value from a sequence of integers, all capital letters from a sequence
of characters, and all palindromes from a sequence of strings. A palindrome is a
string that reads the same backward and forward (such as, for example, "racecar",
"noon", or "kayak").
