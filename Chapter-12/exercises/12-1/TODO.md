Create a class called **Integer** that has a single, _private_ member variable
of type _int_. Provide a _class constructor_ that outputs a message when an _object_ is created.
Define member functions to _get_ and _set_ the member variable and to output its value. Write
a test program to create and manipulate at least three **Integer** _objects_ and verify that you
canâ€™t assign a value directly to the member variable.
Exercise all the class member functions by _getting_, _setting_, and outputting the value of
the member variable of each object.
Make sure to create at least one _const_ **Integer** object and verify which operations you can
and cannot apply on it.
