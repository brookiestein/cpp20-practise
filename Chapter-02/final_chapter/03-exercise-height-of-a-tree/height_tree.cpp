/* For your birthday youâ€™ve been given a long tape measure and an instrument that
 * measures angles (the angle between the horizontal and a line to the top of a tree, for instance).
 * If you know the distance, d , you are from a tree, and the height, h , of your eye when peering
 * into your angle-measuring device, you can calculate the height of the tree with the formula
 * h + d*tan(angle) . Create a program to read h in inches, d in feet and inches, and angle in
 * degrees from the keyboard, and output the height of the tree in feet.
