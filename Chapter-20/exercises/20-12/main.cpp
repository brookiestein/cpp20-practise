/* Exercise 20-11. Write a function that determines whether a given integer is a prime */
/* number. If you’re lost on how to do this, you can always distill a prime test from */
/* Ex6_05. Now use this function to print out the first 100 prime numbers in reverse order. */
/* Do so without the use of any container. */
/* Hint: You already used the iota(from,to) range factory, but iota(from) is valid as */
/* well. The latter factory call produces a view that, conceptually, contains an infinite */
/* amount of consecutive values, starting with from. Because a view’s elements are */
/* only generated lazily, having a view that is, at least conceptually, infinitely large is no */
/* problem. Just make sure you do not attempt to exhaustively read all elements of such a */
/* view because that might take a while… */
